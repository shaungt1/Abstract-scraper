# Research paper web scraper
> Here is a simple web scraper program I wrote to scrape PubMed data. You can use it for Google Scholar or any other journal source. You will need to find the CSS elements corresponding to the page you are scraping and add your own header to gain access.


## How to target the title, abstract, or keywords of another page not pubmed

-  Use browser dev tools the find the selectors of the element you are targeting and want to scrape the title
- if targeting css directly change this ```response.xpath('//ADD_ELEMENT_NAME HERE_AND _NESTED_PATH/text()').get()```
-  If you want to use ```xpath``` then use dev-tools, right click on element, go to copy, and slelect ```copy xpath`` place it in the response to target the element.```  ```response.xpath('//ADD_YOU_XPATH_HERE/text()')```

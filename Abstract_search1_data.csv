      Advances in early insect detection have been reported using digital technologies through camera systems, sensor networks, and remote sensing coupled with machine learning (ML) modeling. However, up to date, there is no cost-effective system to monitor insect presence accurately and insect-plant interactions. This paper presents results on the implementation of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and a low-cost electronic nose (e-nose) coupled with machine learning. Several artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed based on classification to detect the level of infestation and regression to predict insect numbers for both e-nose and NIR inputs, and plant physiological response based on e-nose to predict photosynthesis rate (A), transpiration (E) and stomatal conductance (gs). Results showed high accuracy for classification models ranging within 96.5-99.3% for NIR and between 94.2-99.2% using e-nose data as inputs. For regression models, high correlation coefficients were obtained for physiological parameters (gs, E and A) using e-nose data from all samples as inputs (R = 0.86) and R = 0.94 considering only control plants (no insect presence). Finally, R = 0.97 for NIR and R = 0.99 for e-nose data as inputs were obtained to predict number of insects. Performances for all models developed showed no signs of overfitting. In this paper, a field-based system using unmanned aerial vehicles with the e-nose as payload was proposed and described for deployment of ML models to aid growers in pest management practices.

      Breath analysis based on electronic nose (e-nose) is a promising new technology for the detection of lung cancer that is non-invasive, simple to operate and cost-effective. Lung cancer screening by e-nose relies on predictive models established using machine learning methods. However, using only a single machine learning method to detect lung cancer has some disadvantages, including low detection accuracy and high false negative rate. To address these problems, groups of individual learning models with excellent performance were selected from classic models, including support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, logistic regression and"

      The brown core is an internal disorder that significantly affects the palatability and economic value of Chinese pears. In this study, a framework that includes a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and extreme learning machine (ELM) (BP-ELMNN) was proposed for the detection of brown core in the Chinese pear variety Huangguan. The odor data of pear were collected using a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) electronic nose (E-nose). Principal component analysis was used to analyze the complexity of the odor emitted by pears with brown cores. The performances of several machine learning algorithms, i.e., radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), BPNN, and ELM, were compared with that of the BP-ELMNN. The experimental results showed that the proposed framework provided the best results for the test samples, with an accuracy of 0.9683, a macro-precision of 0.9688, a macro-recall of 0.9683, and a macro-F1 score of 0.9685. The results demonstrate that the use of machine learning algorithms for the analysis of E-nose data is a feasible and non-destructive method to detect brown core in pears.

      Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are chemicals emitted by various groups, such as foods, bacteria, and plants. While there are specific pathways and biological features significantly related to such VOCs, detection of these is achieved mostly by human odor testing or high-end methods such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry that can analyze the gaseous component. However, odor characterization can be quite helpful in the rapid classification of some samples in sufficient concentrations. Lower-cost metal-oxide gas sensors have the potential to allow the same type of detection with less training required. Here, we report a portable, battery-powered electronic nose system that utilizes multiple metal-oxide gas sensors and machine learning algorithms to detect and classify VOCs. An in-house circuit was designed with ten metal-oxide sensors and voltage dividers; an STM32 microcontroller was used for data acquisition with 12-bit analog-to-digital conversion. For classification of target samples, a supervised machine learning algorithm such as support vector machine (SVM) was applied to classify the VOCs based on the measurement results. The coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by mean) of 8 of the 10 sensors stayed below 10%, indicating the excellent repeatability of these sensors. As a proof of concept, four different types of wine samples and three different oil samples were classified, and the training model reported 100% and 98% accuracy based on the confusion matrix analysis, respectively. When the trained model was challenged against new sets of data, sensitivity and specificity of 98.5% and 98.6% were achieved for the wine test and 96.3% and 93.3% for the oil test, respectively, when the SVM classifier was used. These results suggest that the metal-oxide sensors are suitable for usage in food authentication applications.

      Meat adulteration is a global problem which undermines market fairness and harms people with allergies or certain religious beliefs. In this study, a novel framework in which a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) serves as a backbone and a random forest regressor (RFR) serves as a regressor, named 1DCNN-RFR, is proposed for the quantitative detection of beef adulterated with pork using electronic nose (E-nose) data. The 1DCNN backbone extracted a sufficient number of features from a multichannel input matrix converted from the raw E-nose data. The RFR improved the regression performance due to its strong prediction ability. The effectiveness of the 1DCNN-RFR framework was verified by comparing it with four other models (support vector regression model (SVR), RFR, backpropagation neural network (BPNN), and 1DCNN). The proposed 1DCNN-RFR framework performed best in the quantitative detection of beef adulterated with pork. This study indicated that the proposed 1DCNN-RFR framework could be used as an effective tool for the quantitative detection of meat adulteration.

      In this data article, we provide a time series dataset obtained for an application of wine quality detection focused on spoilage thresholds. The database contains 235 recorded measurements of wines divided into three groups and labeled as high quality (HQ), average quality (AQ) and low quality (LQ), in addition to 65 ethanol measurements. This dataset was collected using an electronic nose system (E-Nose) based on Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors, self-developed at the Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco (Brazil). The dataset is related to the research article entitled ""Wine quality rapid detection using a compact electronic nose system: application focused on spoilage thresholds by acetic acid"" by Rodriguez Gamboa et al., 2019. The dataset can be accessed publicly at the repository: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/vpc887d53s/.

      In this study, a portable electronic nose (E-nose) prototype is developed using metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensors to detect odors of different wines. Odor detection facilitates the distinction of wines with different properties, including areas of production, vintage years, fermentation processes, and varietals. Four popular machine learning algorithms-extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and backpropagation neural network (BPNN)-were used to build identification models for different classification tasks. Experimental results show that BPNN achieved the best performance, with accuracies of 94% and 92.5% in identifying production areas and varietals, respectively; and SVM achieved the best performance in identifying vintages and fermentation processes, with accuracies of 67.3% and 60.5%, respectively. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed E-nose, which could be used to distinguish different wines based on their properties following selection of an optimal algorithm.

      This paper deals with the classification of stenches, which can stimulate olfactory organs to discomfort people and pollute the environment. In China, the triangle odor bag method, which only depends on the state of the panelist, is widely used in determining odor concentration. In this paper, we propose a stenches detection system composed of an electronic nose and machine learning algorithms to discriminate five typical stenches. These five chemicals producing stenches are 2-phenylethyl alcohol, isovaleric acid, methylcyclopentanone, Î³-undecalactone, and 2-methylindole. We will use random forest, support vector machines, backpropagation neural network, principal components analysis (PCA), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in this paper. The result shows that LDA (support vector machine (SVM)) has better performance in detecting the stenches considered in this paper.

      Aroma is one of the main attributes that consumers consider when appreciating and selecting a coffee; hence it is considered an important quality trait. However, the most common methods to assess aroma are based on expensive equipment or human senses through sensory evaluation, which is time-consuming and requires highly trained assessors to avoid subjectivity. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the coffee intensity and aromas using a low-cost and portable electronic nose (e-nose) and machine learning modeling. For this purpose, triplicates of nine commercial coffee samples with different intensity levels were used for this study. Two machine learning models were developed based on artificial neural networks using the data from the e-nose as inputs to (i) classify the samples into low, medium, and high-intensity (Model 1) and (ii) to predict the relative abundance of 45 different aromas (Model 2). Results showed that it is possible to estimate the intensity of coffees with high accuracy (98%; Model 1), as well as to predict the specific aromas obtaining a high correlation coefficient (R = 0.99), and no under- or over-fitting of the models were detected. The proposed contactless, nondestructive, rapid, reliable, and low-cost method showed to be effective in evaluating volatile compounds in coffee, which is a potential technique to be applied within all stages of the production process to detect any undesirable characteristics on-time and ensure high-quality products.

      For an electronic nose (E-nose) in wound infection distinguishing, traditional learning methods have always needed large quantities of labeled wound infection samples, which are both limited and expensive; thus, we introduce self-taught learning combined with sparse autoencoder and radial basis function (RBF) into the field. Self-taught learning is a kind of transfer learning that can transfer knowledge from other fields to target fields, can solve such problems that labeled data (target fields) and unlabeled data (other fields) do not share the same class labels, even if they are from entirely different distribution. In our paper, we obtain numerous cheap unlabeled pollutant gas samples (benzene, formaldehyde, acetone and ethylalcohol); however, labeled wound infection samples are hard to gain. Thus, we pose self-taught learning to utilize these gas samples, obtaining a basis vector Î¸. Then, using the basis vector Î¸, we reconstruct the new representation of wound infection samples under sparsity constraint, which is the input of classifiers. We compare RBF with partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA), and reach a conclusion that the performance of RBF is superior to others. We also change the dimension of our data set and the quantity of unlabeled data to search the input matrix that produces the highest accuracy.

      The complexity of the human sense of smell is increasingly reflected in complex and high-dimensional data, which opens opportunities for data-driven approaches that complement hypothesis-driven research. Contemporary developments in computational and data science, with its currently most popular implementation as machine learning, facilitate complex data-driven research approaches. The use of machine learning in human olfactory research included major approaches comprising 1) the study of the physiology of pattern-based odor detection and recognition processes, 2) pattern recognition in olfactory phenotypes, 3) the development of complex disease biomarkers including olfactory features, 4) odor prediction from physico-chemical properties of volatile molecules, and 5) knowledge discovery in publicly available big databases. A limited set of unsupervised and supervised machine-learned methods has been used in these projects, however, the increasing use of contemporary methods of computational science is reflected in a growing number of reports employing machine learning for human olfactory research. This review provides key concepts of machine learning and summarizes current applications on human olfactory data.

      Mycotoxin represents a significant concern for the safety of food and feed products, and wheat represents one of the most susceptible crops. To manage this issue, fast, reliable, and low-cost test methods are needed for regulated mycotoxins. This study aimed to assess the potential use of the electronic nose for the early identification of wheat samples contaminated with deoxynivalenol (DON) above a fixed threshold. A total of 214 wheat samples were collected from commercial fields in northern Italy during the periods 2014-2015 and 2017-2018 and analyzed for DON contamination with a conventional method (GC-MS) and using a portable e-nose ""AIR PEN 3"" (Airsense Analytics GmbH, Schwerin, Germany), equipped with 10 metal oxide sensors for different categories of volatile substances. The Machine Learning approach ""Classification and regression trees"" (CART) was used to categorize samples according to four DON contamination thresholds (1750, 1250, 750, and 500 Î¼g/kg). Overall, this process yielded an accuracy of &gt;83% (correct prediction of DON levels in wheat samples). These findings suggest that the e-nose combined with CART can be an effective quick method to distinguish between compliant and DON-contaminated wheat lots. Further validation including more samples above the legal limits is desirable before concluding the validity of the method.

      How does one tell the difference between one molecule or mixture of molecules from another? Chemical sensing seeks to probe physical or chemical properties of molecular or ionic species (i.e., analytes) and transform that information into a useful and distinguishable output. The olfactory system of animals is the prototype of chemical sensing. Even for human beings (who are generally more visual than olfactory creatures), the sense of smell is one of our most basic capabilities, and we can discriminate among many thousands, and possibly even billions, of different odors. The chemical specificity of the olfactory system does not come from specific receptors for specific analytes (i.e., the traditional lock-and-key model of enzyme-substrate interactions), but rather olfaction uses pattern recognition of the combined responses of several hundred olfactory receptors.In analogy to olfaction, colorimetric sensor arrays provide high dimensional data from the color changes of chemically responsive colorants as they are exposed to analytes. These colorants include pH responsive dyes, Lewis acid/base indicators, redox dyes, vapochromics, and surface-modified silver nanoparticles. The color difference maps so created provide chemical sensing with high sensitivity (often down to ppb levels), impressive discrimination among very similar analytes, and exquisite fingerprinting of extremely similar mixtures over a wide range of analyte types, both in the gas and liquid phases. Such colorimetric arrays probe a wide range of the chemical reactivity of analytes, rather than the limited dimensionality of physical properties (e.g., mass) or physisorption (e.g., traditional electronic noses). Our sensor arrays are disposable and simple to produce by either inkjet or robotic dip-pen printing onto the surface of porous polymer membranes or even paper.Design of both sensor arrays and optical readers for their analysis has advanced to a fully self-contained pocket-sized instrument, the optoelectronic nose. Quantitative analysis requires appropriate chemometric methods for pattern recognition of data with inherently high dimensionality, e.g., hierarchical cluster analysis and support vector machines. A wide range of applications for the colorimetric sensor arrays has been developed, including personal dosimetry of toxic industrial chemicals, detection of explosives or fire accelerants, monitoring pollutants for artwork and cultural heritage preservation, quality control of foods and beverages, rapid identification of bacteria and fungi, and detection of disease biomarkers in breath or urine. The development of portable, high-accuracy instrumentation using standard imaging devices with the capability of onboard, real-time analysis has had substantial progress and increasingly meets the expectations for real-world use.

      Diabetes mellitus, commonly measured through an invasive process which although is accurate, has manifold drawbacks especially when multiple reading are required at regular intervals. Accordingly, there is a need to develop a dependable non-invasive diabetes detection technique. Recent studies have observed that other human serums such as tears, saliva, urine and breath indicate the presence of glucose in them. These parameters open quite a few ways for non-invasive blood glucose level prediction. The analysis of a persons breath poses as a good non-invasive technique to monitor the glucose levels. It is seen that in breath, there are many bio-markers and monitoring the levels of these bio-markers indicate the possibility of various chronic diseases. Among these bio-markers, acetone a volatile organic compound found in breath has shown a good correlation to the glucose levels present in blood. Therefore, by evaluating the acetone levels in breath samples it is possible to monitor diabetes non-invasively. This paper reviews the various approaches and sensory techniques used to monitor diabetes though human breath samples.

      The present study was aimed at developing a low-cost but rapid technique for qualitative and quantitative detection of beef adulterated with pork. An electronic nose based on colorimetric sensors was proposed. The fresh beef rib steaks and streaky pork were purchased and used from the local agricultural market in Suzhou, China. The minced beef was mixed with pork ranging at levels from 0%~100% by weight at increments of 20%. Protein, fat, and ash content were measured for validation of the differences between the pure beef and pork used in basic chemical compositions. Fisher linear discriminant analysis (Fisher LDA) and extreme learning machine (ELM) were utilized comparatively for identification of the ground pure beef, beef-pork mixtures, and pure pork. Back propagation-artificial neural network (BP-ANN) models were built for prediction of the adulteration levels. Results revealed that the ELM model built was superior to the Fisher LDA model with higher identification rates of 91.27% and 87.5% in the training and prediction sets respectively. Regarding the adulteration level prediction, the correlation coefficient and the root mean square error were 0.85 and 0.147 respectively in the prediction set of the BP-ANN model built. This suggests, from all the results, that the low-cost electronic nose based on colorimetric sensors coupled with chemometrics has a great potential in rapid detection of beef adulterated with pork.

      Apples are one of the most widely planted fruits in the world, with an extremely high annual production. Several issues should be addressed to avoid the damaging of samples during the quality grading process of apples (e.g., the long detection period and the inability to detect the internal quality of apples). In this study, an electronic nose (e-nose) detection system for apple quality grading based on the K-nearest neighbor support vector machine (KNN-SVM) was designed, and the nasal cavity structure of the e-nose was optimized by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. A KNN-SVM classifier was also proposed to overcome the shortcomings of the traditional SVMs. The performance of the developed device was experimentally verified in the following steps. The apples were divided into three groups according to their external and internal quality. The e-nose data were pre-processed before features extraction, and then Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) were used to reduce the dimension of the datasets. The recognition accuracy of the PCA-KNN-SVM classifier was 96.45%, and the LDA-KNN-SVM classifier achieved 97.78%. Compared with other commonly used classifiers, (traditional KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest), KNN-SVM is more efficient in terms of training time and accuracy of classification. Generally, the apple grading system can be used to evaluate the quality of apples during storage.

      Rapid diagnosis is key to curtailing the Covid-19 pandemic. One path to such rapid diagnosis may rely on identifying volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by the infected body, or in other words, identifying the smell of the infection. Consistent with this rationale, dogs can use their nose to identify Covid-19 patients. Given the scale of the pandemic, however, animal deployment is a challenging solution. In contrast, electronic noses (eNoses) are machines aimed at mimicking animal olfaction, and these can be deployed at scale. To test the hypothesis that SARS CoV-2 infection is associated with a body-odor detectable by an eNose, we placed a generic eNose in-line at a drive-through testing station. We applied a deep learning classifier to the eNose measurements, and achieved real-time detection of SARS CoV-2 infection at a level significantly better than chance, for both symptomatic and non-symptomatic participants. This proof of concept with a generic eNose implies that an optimized eNose may allow effective real-time diagnosis, which would provide for extensive relief in the Covid-19 pandemic.

      We used a 16-channel e-nose demonstrator based on micro-capacitive sensors with functionalized surfaces to measure the response of 30 different sensors to the vapours from 11 different substances, including the explosives 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX), 1-methyl-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNT) and 2-methyl-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TNT). A classification model was developed using the Random Forest machine-learning algorithm and trained the models on a set of signals, where the concentration and flow of a selected single vapour were varied independently. It is demonstrated that our classification models are successful in recognizing the signal pattern of different sets of substances. An excellent accuracy of 96% was achieved for identifying the explosives from among the other substances. These experiments clearly demonstrate that the silane monolayers used in our sensors as receptor layers are particularly well suited to selecting and recognizing TNT and similar types of explosives from among other substances.

      The winemaking industry can benefit greatly by implementing digital technologies to avoid guesswork and the development of off-flavors and aromas in the final wines. This research presents results on the implementation of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and a low-cost electronic nose (e-nose) coupled with machine learning to detect and assess wine faults. For this purpose, red and white base wines were used, and treatments consisted of spiked samples with 12 faults that are traditionally formed in wines. Results showed high accuracy in the classification models using NIR and e-nose for red wines (94-96%; 92-97%, respectively) and white wines (96-97%; 90-97%, respectively). Implementing new and emerging digital technologies could be a turning point for the winemaking industry to become more predictive in terms of decision-making and maintaining and increasing wine quality traits in a changing and challenging climate.

      In human exhaled breath, more than 3000 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are found, which are directly or indirectly related to internal biochemical processes in the body. Electronic noses (E-noses) could play a potential role in screening/analyzing various respiratory and systemic diseases by studying breath signatures. An E-nose integrates a sensor array and an artificial neural network that responds to specific patterns of VOCs, and thus can act as a non-invasive technology for disease monitoring. The gold standard blood glucose monitoring test for diabetes diagnostics is invasive and highly uncomfortable. This contributes to the massive need for technologies which are non-invasive and can be used as an alternative to blood measurements for glucose detection. While lung cancer is one of the deadliest cancers with the highest death rate and an extremely high yearly global burden, the conventional diagnosis means, such as sputum cytology, chest radiography, or computed tomography, do not support wide-range population screening. A few standard non-invasive techniques, such as mass spectrometry and gas chromatography, are expensive, non-portable, and require skilled personnel for operation and are again not suitable for large-scale screening. Breath contains markers for both diabetes and lung cancer along with markers for several diseases and thus, a non-invasive technique such as the E-nose would greatly improve analysis procedures over existing invasive methods. This review shows the state-of-the-art technologies for VOC detection and machine learning approaches for two clinical models: diabetes and lung cancer detection.

      This study aims to develop an engineering solution to breath tests using an electronic nose (e-nose), and evaluate its diagnosis accuracy for silicosis. Influencing factors of this technique were explored. 398 non-silicosis miners and 221 silicosis miners were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Exhaled breath was analyzed by an array of 16 organic nanofiber sensors along with a customized sample processing system. Principal component analysis was used to visualize the breath data, and classifiers were trained by two improved cost-sensitive ensemble algorithms (random forest and extreme gradient boosting) and two classical algorithms (K-nearest neighbor and support vector machine). All subjects were included to train the screening model, and an early detection model was run with silicosis cases in stage I. Both 5-fold cross-validation and external validation were adopted. Difference in classifiers caused by algorithms and subjects was quantified using a two-factor analysis of variance. The association between personal smoking habits and classification was investigated by the chi-square test. Classifiers of ensemble learning performed well in both screening and early detection model, with an accuracy range of 0.817-0.987. Classical classifiers showed relatively worse performance.

      Breath pattern analysis based on an electronic nose (e-nose), which is a noninvasive, fast, and low-cost method, has been continuously used for detecting human diseases, including the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Nevertheless, having big data with several available features is not always beneficial because only a few of them will be relevant and useful to distinguish different breath samples (i.e., positive and negative COVID-19 samples). In this study, we develop a hybrid machine learning-based algorithm combining hierarchical agglomerative clustering analysis and permutation feature importance method to improve the data analysis of a portable e-nose for COVID-19 detection (GeNose C19). Utilizing this learning approach, we can obtain an effective and optimum feature combination, enabling the reduction by half of the number of employed sensors without downgrading the classification model performance. Based on the cross-validation test results on the training data, the hybrid algorithm can result in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values of (86 Â± 3)%, (88 Â± 6)%, and (84 Â± 6)%, respectively. Meanwhile, for the testing data, a value of 87% is obtained for all the three metrics. These results exhibit the feasibility of using this hybrid filter-wrapper feature-selection method to pave the way for optimizing the GeNose C19 performance.

      This article provides a dataset of several weight combinations from the adulteration of pork in beef using an electronic nose (e-nose). Seven combinations mixtures have been built, they were 100% pure beef, 10% mixed with pork, 25% mixed with pork, 50% mixed with pork, 75% mixed with pork, 90% mixed with pork, and 100% pure pork. By using this combination, a minimum of 10% of a mixture of pork or beef can be detected. In each experiment cycle, data were collected for 120 s using an e-nose. The availability of this dataset can enable further research about meat adulteration, Halal authentication, etc. For several cases, food adulteration is one of the main concerns in food science, for example, due to economic, religious reasons, etc. This dataset can also be utilized as the data source for several interesting topics such as signal processing, sensor selection, e-nose development, machine learning algorithms, etc.

      Lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies and has a low 5-year survival rate. There are no cheap, simple and widely available screening methods for the early diagnostics of lung cancer. The aim of this study was to determine whether analysis of exhaled breath with an artificial olfactory sensor using support vector analysis can differentiate patients with lung cancer from healthy individuals and patients with other lung diseases, regardless of the stage of lung cancer and the most common comorbidities. Patients with histologically or cytologically verified lung cancer, healthy volunteers and patients with other lung diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, benign lung tumors) were enrolled in the study. Breath sample collection and analysis with a Cyranose 320 sensor device was performed and data were further analyzed using a support vector machine (SVM). The SVM correctly differentiated between cancer patients and healthy volunteers in 98.8% of cases. The cancer versus non-cancer group patients (healthy volunteers and patients with other lung diseases) were classified correctly by SVM in 87.3% of cases. In the mixed diagnosis groups (only cancer, only COPD, cancer + COPD and control) all 79 out of 79 patients were predicted correctly in the cancer + COPD group, with the rate of correct prognosis in other patient groups being lower. Exhaled breath analysis by electronic nose using a SVM is able to discriminate patients with lung cancer from healthy subjects and mixed groups of patients with different lung diseases. It can also provide a certain level of discrimination between lung cancer patients, lung cancer patients with concomitant COPD, COPD alone and a healthy control group.

      For the agricultural food production sector, the control and assessment of food quality is an essential issue, which has a direct impact on both human health and the economic value of the product. One of the fundamental properties from which the quality of the food can be derived is the smell of the product. A significant trend in this context is machine olfaction or the automated simulation of the sense of smell using a so-called electronic nose or e-nose. Hereby, many sensors are used to detect compounds, which define the odors and herewith the quality of the product. The proper assessment of the food quality is based on the correct functioning of the adopted sensors. Unfortunately, sensors may fail to provide the correct measures due to, for example, physical aging or environmental factors. To tolerate this problem, various approaches have been applied, often focusing on correcting the input data from the failed sensor. In this study, we adopt an alternative approach and propose machine learning-based failure tolerance that ignores failed sensors. To tolerate for the failed sensor and to keep the overall prediction accuracy acceptable, a Single Plurality Voting System (SPVS) classification approach is used. Hereby, single classifiers are trained by each feature and based on the outcome of these classifiers, and a composed classifier is built. To build our SPVS-based technique, K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Decision Tree, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifiers are applied as the base classifiers. Our proposed approach has a clear advantage over traditional machine learning models since it can tolerate the sensor failure or other types of failures by ignoring and thus enhance the assessment of food quality. To illustrate our approach, we use the case study of beef cut quality assessment. The experiments showed promising results for beef cut quality prediction in particular, and food quality assessment in general.

      Chirality is essential in nature and often pivotal for biological information transfer, for example, via odor messenger molecules. While the human nose can distinguish the enantiomers of many chiral odors, the technical realization by an artificial sensor or an electronic nose, e-nose, remains a challenge. Herein, we present an array of six sensors coated with nanoporous metal-organic framework (MOF) films of different homochiral and achiral structures, working as an enantioselective e-nose. While the achiral-MOF-film sensors show identical responses for both isomers of one chiral odor molecule, the responses of the homochiral MOF films differ for different enantiomers. By machine learning algorithms, the combined array data allow the stereoselective identification of all compounds, here tested for five pairs of chiral odor molecules. We foresee the chiral-MOF-e-nose, able to enantioselectively detect and discriminate chiral odors, to be a powerful approach towards advanced odor sensing.

      Electronic noses (e-nose) and optical noses (o-nose) are two emerging approaches for the development of artificial olfactory systems for flavor and smell evaluation. The current work leverages the unique optical properties of semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) to develop a prototype of a novel paper-based near-infrared optical nose (NIRON). We have drop-dried an array of SWCNTs encapsulated with a wide variety of peptides on a paper substrate and continuously imaged the emitted SWCNTs fluorescence using a CMOS camera. Odors and different volatile molecules were passed above the array in a flow chamber, resulting in unique modulation patterns of the SWCNT photoluminescence (PL). Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements performed in parallel confirmed the direct binding between the vapor molecules and the peptide-SWCNTs. PL levels measured before and during exposure demonstrate distinct responses to the four tested alcoholic vapors (ethanol, methanol, propanol, and isopropanol). In addition, machine learning tools directly applied to the fluorescence images allow us to distinguish between the aromas of red wine, beer, and vodka. Further, we show that the developed sensor can detect limonene, undecanal, and geraniol vapors, and differentiate between their smells utilizing the PL response pattern. This novel paper-based optical biosensor provides data in real-time, and is recoverable and suitable for working at room temperature and in a wide range of humidity levels. This platform opens new avenues for real-time sensing of volatile chemical compounds, odors, and flavors.

      Electronic nose (E-nose), as a device intended to detect odors or flavors, has been widely used in many fields. Many labeled samples are needed to gain an ideal E-nose classification model. However, the labeled samples are not easy to obtain and there are some cases where the gas samples in the real world are complex and unlabeled. As a result, it is necessary to make an E-nose that cannot only classify unlabeled samples, but also use these samples to modify its classification model. In this paper, we first introduce a semi-supervised learning algorithm called S4VMs and improve its use within a multi-classification algorithm to classify the samples for an E-nose. Then, we enhance its performance by adding the unlabeled samples that it has classified to modify its model and by using an optimization algorithm called quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) to find the optimal parameters for classification. The results of comparing this with other semi-supervised learning algorithms show that our multi-classification algorithm performs well in the classification system of an E-nose after learning from unlabeled samples.

      We devised a low-cost mobile electronic nose (e-nose) system using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor array functionalized with various polymer-based thin active films (i.e., polyacrylonitrile, poly(vinylidene fluoride), poly(vinyl pyrrolidone), and poly(vinyl acetate)). It works based on the gravimetric detection principle, where the additional mass of the adsorbed molecules on the polymer surface can induce QCM resonance frequency shifts. To collect and process the obtained sensing data sets, a multichannel data acquisition (DAQ) circuitry was developed and calibrated using a function generator resulting in a device frequency resolution of 0.5 Hz. Four prepared QCM sensors demonstrated various sensitivity levels with high reproducibility and consistency under exposure to seven different volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Moreover, two types of machine learning algorithms (i.e., linear discriminant analysis and support vector machine models) were employed to differentiate and classify those tested analytes, in which classification accuracies of up to 98 and 99% could be obtained, respectively. This high-performance e-nose system is expected to be used as a versatile sensing platform for performing reliable qualitative and quantitative analyses in complex gaseous mixtures containing numerous VOCs for early disease diagnosis and environmental quality monitoring.

      Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from stool are the components of the smell of stool representing the end products of microbial activity and metabolism that can be used to diagnose disease. Despite the abundance of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane that have already been identified in human flatus, the small portion of trace gases making up the VOCs emitted from stool include organic acids, alcohols, esters, heterocyclic compounds, aldehydes, ketones, and alkanes, among others. These are the gases that vary among individuals in sickness and in health, in dietary changes, and in gut microbial activity. Electronic nose devices are analytical and pattern recognition platforms that can utilize mass spectrometry or electrochemical sensors to detect these VOCs in gas samples. When paired with machine-learning and pattern recognition algorithms, this can identify patterns of VOCs, and thus patterns of smell, that can be used to identify disease states. In this review, we provide a clinical background of VOC identification, electronic nose development, and review gastroenterology applications toward diagnosing disease by the volatile headspace analysis of stool.

      A novel multi-class classification method for bacteria detection termed quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization-based kernel extreme learning machine (QPSO-KELM) based on an electronic nose (E-nose) technology is proposed in this paper. Time and frequency domain features are extracted from E-nose signals used for detecting four different classes of wounds (uninfected and infected with Staphylococcu aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in this experiment. In addition, KELM is compared with five existing classification methods: Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), extreme learning machine (ELM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM). Meanwhile, three traditional optimization methods including particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA) and grid search algorithm (GS) and four kernel functions (Gaussian kernel, linear kernel, polynomial kernel and wavelet kernel) for KELM are discussed in this experiment. Finally, the QPSO-KELM model is also used to deal with another two experimental E-nose datasets in the previous experiments. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of QPSO-KELM in various E-nose applications.

      With the recent advancement in analytic techniques and the increasing generation of healthcare data, artificial intelligence (AI) is reinventing the healthcare system for tackling pandemics securely in smart cities. AI tools continue register numerous successes in major disease areas such as cancer, neurology and now in new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) detection. COVID-19 patients often experience several symptoms which include breathlessness, fever, cough, nausea, sore throat, blocked nose, runny nose, headache, muscle aches, and joint pains. This paper proposes an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that predicts the rate of likely survivals of COVID-19 suspected patients based on good immune system, exercises and age quantiles securely. Four algorithms (NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN)) were compared. We performed True Positive (TP) rate and False Positive (FP) rate analysis on both positive and negative covid patients data. The experimental results show that kNN, and Decision Tree both obtained a score of 99.30% while NaÃ¯ve Bayes and Logistic Regression obtained 91.70% and 99.20%, respectively on TP rate for negative patients. For positive covid patients, NaÃ¯ve Bayes outperformed other models with a score of 10.90%. On the other hand, NaÃ¯ve Bayes obtained a score of 89.10% for FP rate for negative patients while Logistic Regression, kNN, and Decision Tree obtained scores of 93.90%, 93.90%, and 94.50%, respectively.

      Monitoring of chemical species in breath offers an approach for the detection of disease and other conditions that cause homeostatic imbalance. Here, we demonstrate the use of microsensor-based devices for detecting select biomarkers in simulated exhaled breath as a step toward enabling fast and inexpensive breath-screening technology. Microhotplate elements functionalized with three chemiresistive metal-oxide films (SnO(2), In(2)O(3), and CuO) were used to acquire data in simulated breath containing single targets [(5 to 20) Î¼mol/mol ammonia, methanol, and acetone], as well as mixtures of those species. All devices were operated with programmed thermal cycles featuring rapid temperature excursions, during which film resistances were measured. Material-specific temperature programs were optimized to achieve temperature-dependent metal-oxide sensing film conductance levels and target selectivity. A supervised hierarchical machine-learning algorithm using linear discriminant analysis for dimensional reduction of sensing data and discrimination was developed. This algorithm was employed in the classification and quantification of biomarkers. This approach to microsensor data collection and processing was successful in classifying and quantifying the model biomarkers in validation-set mixtures.

      When it comes to detecting volatile chemicals, biological olfactory systems far outperform all artificial chemical detection devices in their versatility, speed, and specificity. Consequently, the use of trained animals for chemical detection in security, defense, healthcare, agriculture, and other applications has grown astronomically. However, the use of animals in this capacity requires extensive training and behavior-based communication. Here we propose an alternative strategy, a bio-electronic nose, that capitalizes on the superior capability of the mammalian olfactory system, but bypasses behavioral output by reading olfactory information directly from the brain. We engineered a brain-computer interface that captures neuronal signals from an early stage of olfactory processing in awake mice combined with machine learning techniques to form a sensitive and selective chemical detector. We chronically implanted a grid electrode array on the surface of the mouse olfactory bulb and systematically recorded responses to a large battery of odorants and odorant mixtures across a wide range of concentrations. The bio-electronic nose has a comparable sensitivity to the trained animal and can detect odors on a variable background. We also introduce a novel genetic engineering approach that modifies the relative abundance of particular olfactory receptors in order to improve the sensitivity of our bio-electronic nose for specific chemical targets. Our recordings were stable over months, providing evidence for robust and stable decoding over time. The system also works in freely moving animals, allowing chemical detection to occur in real-world environments. Our bio-electronic nose outperforms current methods in terms of its stability, specificity, and versatility, setting a new standard for chemical detection.

      The reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) approach has been widely used to detect the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, instead of using it alone, clinicians often prefer to diagnose the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by utilizing a combination of clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory test, imaging measurement (e.g., chest computed tomography scan), and multivariable clinical prediction models, including the electronic nose. Here, we report on the development and use of a low cost, noninvasive method to rapidly sniff out COVID-19 based on a portable electronic nose (GeNose C19) integrating an array of metal oxide semiconductor gas sensors, optimized feature extraction, and machine learning models. This approach was evaluated in profiling tests involving a total of 615 breath samples composed of 333 positive and 282 negative samples. The samples were obtained from 43 positive and 40 negative COVID-19 patients, respectively, and confirmed with RT-qPCR at two hospitals located in the Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Four different machine learning algorithms (i.e., linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, stacked multilayer perceptron, and deep neural network) were utilized to identify the top-performing pattern recognition methods and to obtain a high system detection accuracy (88-95%), sensitivity (86-94%), and specificity (88-95%) levels from the testing datasets. Our results suggest that GeNose C19 can be considered a highly potential breathalyzer for fast COVID-19 screening.

      The McDevitt group has sustained efforts to develop a programmable sensing platform that offers advanced, multiplexed/multiclass chem-/bio-detection capabilities. This scalable chip-based platform has been optimized to service real-world biological specimens and validated for analytical performance. Fashioned as a sensor that learns, the platform can host new content for the application at hand. Identification of biomarker-based fingerprints from complex mixtures has a direct linkage to e-nose and e-tongue research. Recently, we have moved to the point of big data acquisition alongside the linkage to machine learning and artificial intelligence. Here, exciting opportunities are afforded by multiparameter sensing that mimics the sense of taste, overcoming the limitations of salty, sweet, sour, bitter, and glutamate sensing and moving into fingerprints of health and wellness. This article summarizes developments related to the electronic taste chip system evolving into a platform that digitizes biology and affords clinical decision support tools. A dynamic body of literature and key review articles that have contributed to the shaping of these activities are also highlighted. This fully integrated sensor promises more rapid transition of biomarker panels into wide-spread clinical practice yielding valuable new insights into health diagnostics, benefiting early disease detection.

      This work details the application of a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensor based electronic nose (e-nose) system in the discrimination of lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from healthy controls. The sensor array integrated with supervised classification algorithms was able to detect and classify exhaled breath samples from healthy controls, patients with COPD, and lung cancer by recognizing the amount of volatile organic compounds present in it. This paper details the e-nose design, participant selection, sampling methods, and data analysis. The clinical feasibility of the system was checked in 32 lung cancer patients, 38 COPD patients, and 72 healthy controls including smokers and non-smokers. One of the advantages of the equipment design was portability and robustness since the system was conditioned with elements that allowed its easy movement. In the discrimination of lung cancer from controls, the k-nearest neighbors gave an acceptable accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 91.3%, 84.4%, and 94.4% respectively. The support vector machine gave better results for COPD discrimination from controls with 90.9% accuracy, 81.6% sensitivity, and 95.8% specificity. Even though the attained results were good, further examinations are essential to enhance the sensor array system, investigate the long-run reproducibility, repeatability, and enlarge its relevancy.

      Aroma plays a significant role in the quality of citrus fruits and processed products. The detection and analysis of citrus volatiles can be measured by an electronic nose (E-nose); in this paper, an E-nose is employed to classify the juice which is stored for different days. Feature extraction and classification are two important requirements for an E-nose. During the training process, a classifier can optimize its own parameters to achieve a better classification accuracy but cannot decide its input data which is treated by feature extraction methods, so the classification result is not always ideal. Label consistent KSVD (L-KSVD) is a novel technique which can extract the feature and classify the data at the same time, and such an operation can improve the classification accuracy. We propose an enhanced L-KSVD called E-LCKSVD for E-nose in this paper. During E-LCKSVD, we introduce a kernel function to the traditional L-KSVD and present a new initialization technique of its dictionary; finally, the weighted coefficients of different parts of its object function is studied, and enhanced quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (EQPSO) is employed to optimize these coefficients. During the experimental section, we firstly find the classification accuracy of KSVD, and L-KSVD is improved with the help of the kernel function; this can prove that their ability of dealing nonlinear data is improved. Then, we compare the results of different dictionary initialization techniques and prove our proposed method is better. Finally, we find the optimal value of the weighted coefficients of the object function of E-LCKSVD that can make E-nose reach a better performance.

      In response to one of the most important challenges of the century, i.e., the estimation of the food demands of a growing population, advanced technologies have been employed in agriculture. The potato has the main contribution to people's diet worldwide. Therefore, its different aspects are worth studying. The large number of potato varieties, lack of awareness about its new cultivars among farmers to cultivate, time-consuming and inaccurate process of identifying different potato cultivars, and the significance of identifying potato cultivars and other agricultural products (in every food industry process) all necessitate new, fast, and accurate methods. The aim of this study was to use an electronic nose, along with chemometrics methods, including PCA, LDA, and ANN as fast, inexpensive, and non-destructive methods for detecting different potato cultivars. In the present study, nine sensors with the best response to VOCs were adopted. VOCs sensors were used at various VOCs concentrations (1 to 10,000 ppm) to detect different gases. The results showed that a PCA with two main components, PC1 and PC2, described 92% of the total samples' dataset variance. In addition, the accuracy of the LDA and ANN methods were 100 and 96%, respectively.

      Technologies that enable frequent, objective, and precise measurement of ataxia severity would benefit clinical trials by lowering participation barriers and improving the ability to measure disease state and change. We hypothesized that analyzing characteristics of sub-second movement profiles obtained during a reaching task would be useful for objectively quantifying motor characteristics of ataxia. Participants with ataxia (N=88), participants with parkinsonism (N=44), and healthy controls (N=34) performed a computer tablet version of the finger-to-nose test while wearing inertial sensors on their wrists. Data features designed to capture signs of ataxia were extracted from participants' decomposed wrist velocity time-series. A machine learning regression model was trained to estimate overall ataxia severity, as measured by the Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS). Classification models were trained to distinguish between ataxia participants and controls and between ataxia and parkinsonism phenotypes. Movement decomposition revealed expected and novel characteristics of the ataxia phenotype. The distance, speed, duration, morphology, and temporal relationships of decomposed movements exhibited strong relationships with disease severity.

      Polyaniline (PANI) films are promising candidates for electronic nose-based IoT applications, but device performances are influenced by fabrication parameters and ambient conditions. Affinities of different PANI composites to analytes for gas sensing applications remain elusive. In this study, we investigate the material properties in detail for two different dopant systems: F4TCNQ and carbon black. Using a reproducibility-driven approach, we investigate different dopant concentrations in regard to their sensitivity and specificity towards five relevant markers for breath cancer diagnosis. We benchmark the system using ammonia measurements and evaluate limits of detection. Furthermore, we provide statistical analysis on reproducibility and pave the way towards machine learning discrimination via principal component analysis. The influence of relative humidity on sensor hysteresis is also investigated. We find that F4TCNQ-doped PANI films show improved reproducibility compared to carbon black-doped films. We establish and quantify a tradeoff between sensitivity, reproducibility, and environmental stability by the choice of dopant and concentrations ratios.

      Effective strategies to restrain COVID-19 pandemic need high attention to mitigate negatively impacted communal health and global economy, with the brim-full horizon yet to unfold. In the absence of effective antiviral and limited medical resources, many measures are recommended by WHO to control the infection rate and avoid exhausting the limited medical resources. Wearing a mask is among the non-pharmaceutical intervention measures that can be used to cut the primary source of SARS-CoV2 droplets expelled by an infected individual. Regardless of discourse on medical resources and diversities in masks, all countries are mandating coverings over the nose and mouth in public. To contribute towards communal health, this paper aims to devise a highly accurate and real-time technique that can efficiently detect non-mask faces in public and thus, enforcing to wear mask. The proposed technique is ensemble of one-stage and two-stage detectors to achieve low inference time and high accuracy. We start with ResNet50 as a baseline and applied the concept of transfer learning to fuse high-level semantic information in multiple feature maps. In addition, we also propose a bounding box transformation to improve localization performance during mask detection. The experiment is conducted with three popular baseline models viz. ResNet50, AlexNet and MobileNet. We explored the possibility of these models to plug-in with the proposed model so that highly accurate results can be achieved in less inference time. It is observed that the proposed technique achieves high accuracy (98.2%) when implemented with ResNet50. Besides, the proposed model generates 11.07% and 6.44% higher precision and recall in mask detection when compared to the recent public baseline model published as RetinaFaceMask detector. The outstanding performance of the proposed model is highly suitable for video surveillance devices.

      This article discusses the use of a handheld electronic nose to obtain information on the presence of some aromatic defects in natural cork stoppers, such as haloanisoles, alkylmethoxypyrazines, and ketones. Typical concentrations of these compounds (from 5 to 120 ng in the cork samples) have been measured. Two electronic nose prototypes have been developed as an instrumentation system comprise of eight commercial gas sensors to perform two sets of experiments. In the first experiment, a quantitative approach was used whist in the second experiment a qualitative one was used. Machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors and artificial neural networks have been used in order to test the performance of the system to detect cork defects. The use of this system tries to improve the current aromatic defect detection process in the cork stopper industry, which is done by gas chromatography or human test panels. We found this electronic nose to have near 100 % accuracy in the detection of these defects.

      Currently, in clinical practice there is a pressing need for potential biomarkers that can identify lung cancer at early stage before becoming symptomatic or detectable by conventional means. Several researchers have independently pointed out that the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) profile can be considered as a lung cancer fingerprint useful for diagnosis. In particular, 16% of volatiles contributing to the human volatilome are found in urine, which is therefore an ideal sample medium. Its analysis through non-invasive, relatively low-cost and straightforward techniques could offer great potential for the early diagnosis of lung cancer. In this study, urinary VOCs were analysed with a gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometer (GC-IMS) and an electronic nose (e-nose) made by a matrix of twelve quartz microbalances complemented by a photoionization detector. This clinical prospective study involved 127 individuals, divided into two groups: 46 with lung cancer stage I-II-III confirmed by computerized tomography or positron emission tomography-imaging techniques and histology (biopsy), and 81 healthy controls. Both instruments provided a multivariate signal which, after being analysed by a machine learning algorithm, identified eight VOCs that could distinguish lung cancer patients from healthy ones. The eight VOCs are 2-pentanone, 2-hexenal, 2-hexen-1-ol, hept-4-en-2-ol, 2-heptanone, 3-octen-2-one, 4-methylpentanol, 4-methyl-octane. Results show that GC-IMS identifies lung cancer with respect to the control group with a diagnostic accuracy of 88%. Sensitivity resulted as being 85%, and specificity was 90%-Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics: 0.91. The contribution made by the e-nose was also important, even though the results were slightly less sensitive with an accuracy of 71.6%. Moreover, of the eight VOCs identified as potential biomarkers, five VOCs had a high sensitivity ("

      American foulbrood is a dangerous bee disease that attacks the sealed brood. It quickly leads to the death of bee colonies. Efficient diagnosis of this disease is essential. As specific odours are produced when larvae rot, it was investigated whether an electronic nose can distinguish between colonies affected by American foulbrood and healthy ones. The experiment was conducted in an apiary with 18 bee families, 9 of which showed symptoms of the disease confirmed by laboratory diagnostics. Three units of the Beesensor V.2 device based on an array of six semiconductor TGS gas sensors, manufactured by Figaro, were tested. Each copy of the device was tested in all bee colonies: sick and healthy. The measurement session per bee colony lasted 40 min and yielded results from four 10 min measurements. One 10-min measurement consisted of a 5 min regeneration phase and a 5 min object-measurement phase. For the experiments, we used both classical classification methods such as k-nearest neighbour, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, discretized logistic regression, random forests, and committee of classifiers, that is, methods based on extracted representative data fragments. We also used methods based on the entire 600 s series, in this study of sequential neural networks. We considered, in this study, six options for data preparation as part of the transformation of data series into representative results. Among others, we used single stabilised sensor readings as well as average values from stable areas. For verifying the quality of the classical classifiers, we used the 25-fold train-and-test method. The effectiveness of the tested methods reached a threshold of 75 per cent, with results stable between 65 and 70 per cent. As an element to confirm the possibility of class separation using an artificial nose, we used applied visualisations of classes. It is clear from the experiments conducted that the artificial nose tested has practical potential. Our experiments show that the approach to the problem under study by sequential network learning on a sequence of data is comparable to the best classical methods based on discrete data samples. The results of the experiment showed that the Beesensor V.2 along with properly selected classification techniques can become a tool to facilitate rapid diagnosis of American foulbrood under field conditions.

      Rodents have a well-developed sense of smell and are used to detect explosives, mines, illegal substances, hidden currency, and contraband, but it is impossible to keep their concentration constantly. Therefore, there is an ongoing effort to infer odors detected by animals without behavioral readings with brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. However, the invasive BCI technique has the disadvantage that long-term studies are limited by the immune response and electrode movement. On the other hand, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-based BCI technology is a non-invasive method that can measure neuronal activity without worrying about the immune response or electrode movement. This study confirmed that the NIRS-based BCI technology can be used as an odor detection and identification from the rat olfactory system. In addition, we tried to present features optimized for machine learning models by extracting six features, such as slopes, peak, variance, mean, kurtosis, and skewness, from the hemodynamic response, and analyzing the importance of individuals or combinations. As a result, the feature with the highest F1-Score was indicated as slopes, and it was investigated that the combination of the features including slopes and mean was the most important for odor inference. On the other hand, the inclusion of other features with a low correlation with slopes had a positive effect on the odor inference, but most of them resulted in insignificant or rather poor performance. The results presented in this paper are expected to serve as a basis for suggesting the development direction of the hemodynamic response-based bionic nose in the future.

      Devices of human-based senses such as e-noses, e-tongues and e-eyes can be used to analyze different compounds in several food matrices. These sensors allow the detection of one or more compounds present in complex food samples, and the responses obtained can be used for several goals when different chemometric tools are applied. In this systematic review, we used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, to address issues such as e-sensing with chemometric methods for food quality control (FQC). A total of 109 eligible articles were selected from PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. Thus, we predicted that the association between e-sensing and chemometric tools is essential for FQC. Most studies have applied preliminary approaches like exploratory analysis, while the classification/regression methods have been less investigated. It is worth mentioning that non-linear methods based on artificial intelligence/machine learning, in most cases, had classification/regression performances superior to non-liner, although their applications were seen less often. Another approach that has generated promising results is the data fusion between e-sensing devices or in conjunction with other analytical techniques. Furthermore, some future trends in the application of miniaturized devices and nanoscale sensors are also discussed.

      As one of the most reliable and significant indicators, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) becomes a robust predictor of lung cancer early detection, the world's leading cause of cancer death. One of the methods is to analyze the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath using electronic noses (E-noses), which have become emerging tools for analyzing breath because of their potential and promising technology for diagnosing. However, the signal processing of the E-Nose sensor becomes vital in exposing information about the subject condition, which most researchers strive to accomplish. We proposed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to classify COPD in smokers and non-smokers, healthy subjects, and smokers from E-Nose signals to contribute to this field. Two models were constructed following E-Nose signal processing state-of-the-arts. One was by combined feature extraction and classifier, and the second was by CNN, which directly processed the raw signal. In addition, various feature extraction and classifier (Machine Learning and CNN) used in prior research were investigated. Using 3K and 5K Fold cross-validation results demonstrated that our proposed models outperformed in Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) with Fx-ConvNet and Pure-ConvNet. They all reached maximum F1-Score with zero standard deviation values indicating a consistent result. Further experiments also showed that KPCA contributed to the increasing performance of some classifiers with average F1-Score 0.933 and 0.068 as standard deviation values.

      There is an unmet need for a low-cost instrumented technology for detecting sanitation-related malodor as an alert for maintenance around shared toilets and emerging technologies for onsite waste treatment. In this article, our approach to an electronic nose for sanitation-related malodor is based on the use of electrochemical gas sensors, and machine-learning techniques for sensor selection and odor classification. We screened 10 sensors from different vendors with specific target gases and recorded their response to malodor from fecal specimens and urine specimens, and confounding good odors such as popcorn. The analysis of 180 odor exposures data by two feature-selection methods based on mutual information indicates that, for malodor detection, the decision tree (DT) classifier with seven features from four sensors provides 88.0% balanced accuracy and 85.1% macro F1 score. However, the k-nearest-neighbors (KNN) classifier with only three features (from two sensors) obtains 83.3% balanced accuracy and 81.3% macro F1 score. For classification of urine against feces malodor, a balanced accuracy of 94.0% and a macro F1 score of 92.9% are achieved using only four features from three sensors and a logistic regression (LR) classifier.

      Fermented golden pomfret (Trachinotus ovatus) is appreciated by local consumers owing to its distinct flavor. Electronic nose (E-nose) and gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS) technologies were used to analyze the changes in volatile compounds responsible for evolution of the golden pomfret odor profile during fermentation. Forty-five ion peaks were detected using GC-IMS. Although aldehydes represented the major initial volatile compound group, their levels decreased as fermentation proceeded. Between 3 and 15 days, increased levels of esters contributed to a stable volatile organic compounds profile. After 18 days, high levels of indole and pyrazines were detected. Eleven key volatile compounds were screened based on partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) predicted the fermentation stage enabling the development of better strategies to regulate golden pomfret fermentation. This study provided a theoretical basis for real-time monitoring and quality control of Chinese fermented golden pomfet.

      An electronic nose (E-nose) and an electronic tongue (E-tongue) have been used to characterize five types of strawberry juices based on processing approaches (i.e., microwave pasteurization, steam blanching, high temperature short time pasteurization, frozen-thawed, and freshly squeezed). Juice quality parameters (vitamin C, pH, total soluble solid, total acid, and sugar/acid ratio) were detected by traditional measuring methods. Multivariate statistical methods (linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and partial least squares regression (PLSR)) and neural networks (Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines) were employed to qualitative classification and quantitative regression. E-tongue system reached higher accuracy rates than E-nose did, and the simultaneous utilization did have an advantage in LDA classification and PLSR regression. According to cross-validation, RF has shown outstanding and indisputable performances in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. This work indicates that the simultaneous utilization of E-nose and E-tongue can discriminate processed fruit juices and predict quality parameters successfully for the beverage industry.

      Semiconductor metal oxide (SMO) gas sensors are attracting great attention as next-generation environmental monitoring sensors. However, there are limitations to the actual application of SMO gas sensors due to their low selectivity. Although the electronic nose (E-nose) systems based on a sensor array are regarded as a solution for the selectivity issue, poor accuracy caused by the nonuniformity of the fabricated gas sensors and difficulty of real-time gas detection have yet to be resolved. In this study, these problems have been solved by fabricating uniform gas sensor arrays and applying the deep learning algorithm to the data from the sensor arrays.

      In this paper, a portable electronic nose, that was independently developed, was employed to detect and classify a fish meal of different qualities. SPME-GC-MS (solid phase microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry) analysis of fish meal was presented. Due to the large amount of data of the original features detected by the electronic nose, a reasonable selection of the original features was necessary before processing, so as to reduce the dimension. The integral value, wavelet energy value, maximum gradient value, average differential value, relation steady-state response average value and variance value were selected as six different characteristic parameters, to study fish meal samples with different storage time grades. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and five recognition modes, which included the multilayer perceptron neural network classification method, random forest classification method, k nearest neighbor algorithm, support vector machine algorithm, and Bayesian classification method, were employed for the classification. The result showed that the RF classification method had the highest accuracy rate for the classification algorithm. The highest accuracy rate for distinguishing fish meal samples with different qualities was achieved using the integral value, stable value, and average differential value. The lowest accuracy rate for distinguishing fish meal samples with different qualities was achieved using the maximum gradient value. This finding shows that the electronic nose can identify fish meal samples with different storage times.

      A portable electronic nose was used for extracting flavour fingerprint map of Chinese-style sausage during processing and storage, in parallel with detection of acid value (AV) and peroxide value (POV) for evaluating lipid oxidation. Sausage samples during processing and storage were divided into three and five quality phases, respectively. After comparison of sensors response to lipid oxidation, optimal sensor array was determined. Several classification and regression models were developed to classify samples into their respective quality phase and predict lipid oxidation using full and optimal sensor array. Results indicated classification accuracy for sausage samples were, respectively, above 95% and 82% during the processing and storage. For support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) regression models, good performance in predicting AV and POV were obtained, with the coefficients of determination (R"

      Gas sensor arrays, also called electronic noses, use many chemically diverse materials to adsorb and subsequently identify gas species in complex mixture environments. Ideally these materials should have maximally complementary adsorption profiles to achieve the best sensing performance, but in practice they are selected by trial-and-error. Thus current electronic noses do not achieve optimal detection. In this work, we employ metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as sensing materials and leverage a genetic algorithm to identify optimal combinations of them for detecting methane leaks in air. We build on our previously reported computational design methodology, which ranked MOF arrays by their Kullback-Liebler divergence (KLD) values for probabilistically describing the concentrations of each gas species in an unknown mixture. We ran the genetic algorithm to find optimal MOF arrays of various sizes when selecting from a library of 50 different MOF materials. The genetic algorithm was able to accurately predict the best arrays of any desired size when compared to brute-force screening. Thus, this search optimization can be integrated into the efficient design of MOF-based electronic noses.

      Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) still lacks a rapid diagnostic strategy. This study proposes installing a nose-on-a-chip at the proximal end of an expiratory circuit of a ventilator to monitor and to detect metabolite of pneumonia in the early stage. The nose-on-a-chip was designed and fabricated in a 90-nm 1P9M CMOS technology in order to downsize the gas detection system. The chip has eight on-chip sensors, an adaptive interface, a successive approximation analog-to-digital converter (SAR ADC), a learning kernel of continuous restricted Boltzmann machine (CRBM), and a RISC-core with low-voltage SRAM. The functionality of VAP identification was verified using clinical data. In total, 76 samples infected with pneumonia (19 Klebsiella, 25 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 Staphylococcus aureus, and 16 Candida) and 41 uninfected samples were collected as the experimental group and the control group, respectively. The results revealed a very high VAP identification rate at 94.06% for identifying healthy and infected patients. A 100% accuracy to identify the microorganisms of Klebsiella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida from VAP infected patients was achieved. This chip only consumes 1.27 mW at a 0.5 V supply voltage. This work provides a promising solution for the long-term unresolved rapid VAP diagnostic problem.

      In the study, the voltammetric electronic tongue based on three nanocomposites modified electrodes was applied for the identification of rice wines of different geographical origins. The nanocomposites were prepared by gold and copper nanoparticles in the presence of conducting polymers (polymer sulfanilic acid, polymer glutamic acid) and carboxylic multi - walled carbon nanotubes. The modified electrodes showed high sensitivity to guanosine - 5' - monophosphate disodium salt, tyrosine and gallic acid which have good correlation with the geographical origins of rice wines. Scanning electron microscopy was performed to display the surface morphologies of the nanocomposites, and cyclic voltammetry was applied to study the electrochemical behaviors of the taste substances on the electrode surfaces. Four types of electrochemical parameters (pH, scan rates, accumulation potentials and time) were optimized for getting a low limit of the detection of each taste substance. The geographical information of rice wines was obtained by the modified electrodes based on two types of multi - frequency large amplitude pulse voltammetry, and ""area method"" was applied for extracting the feature data from the original information obtained. Based on the area feature data, principal component analysis, locality preserving projection (LPP), and linear discriminant analysis were applied for the classification of the rice wines of different geographical origins, and LPP presented the best results; extreme learning machine (ELM) and alibrary for support vector machines were applied for predicting the geographical origins of rice wines, and ELM performed better.

      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death around the world, and lung cancer screening remains challenging. This study aimed to develop a breath test for the detection of lung cancer using a chemical sensor array and a machine learning technique. We conducted a prospective study to enroll lung cancer cases and non-tumour controls between 2016 and 2018 and analysed alveolar air samples using carbon nanotube sensor arrays. A total of 117 cases and 199 controls were enrolled in the study of which 72 subjects were excluded due to having cancer at another site, benign lung tumours, metastatic lung cancer, carcinoma in situ, minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, received chemotherapy or other diseases. Subjects enrolled in 2016 and 2017 were used for the model derivation and internal validation. The model was externally validated in subjects recruited in 2018. The diagnostic accuracy was assessed using the pathological reports as the reference standard. In the external validation, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were 0.91 (95% CI = 0.79â»1.00) by linear discriminant analysis and 0.90 (95% CI = 0.80â»0.99) by the supportive vector machine technique. The combination of the sensor array technique and machine learning can detect lung cancer with high accuracy.

      The sense of smell helps us navigate the environment, but its molecular architecture and underlying logic remain understudied. The spatial location of odorant receptor genes (Olfrs) in the nose is thought to be independent of the structural diversity of the odorants they detect. Using spatial transcriptomics, we create a genome-wide 3D atlas of the mouse olfactory mucosa (OM). Topographic maps of genes differentially expressed in space reveal that both Olfrs and non-Olfrs are distributed in a continuous and overlapping fashion over at least five broad zones in the OM. The spatial locations of Olfrs correlate with the mucus solubility of the odorants they recognize, providing direct evidence for the chromatographic theory of olfaction. This resource resolves the molecular architecture of the mouse OM and will inform future studies on mechanisms underlying Olfr gene choice, axonal pathfinding, patterning of the nervous system, and basic logic for the peripheral representation of smell.

      To rapidly detect whether apples are infected by fungi, a portable electronic nose was used in this study to collect the gas information from apples, and the collected information was processed by smoothing filtering, data dimensionality reduction, and outlier removal. Following this, we utilized K-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), a convolutional neural network (CNN), a back-propagation neural network (BPNN), a particle swarm optimization-back-propagation neural network (PSO-BPNN), a gray wolf optimization-backward propagation neural network (GWO-BPNN), and a sparrow search algorithm-backward propagation neural network (SSA-BPNN) model to discriminate apple samples, and adopted the 10-fold cross-validation method to evaluate the performance of each model. The results show that SSA can effectively optimize the performance of the BPNN, such that the recognition accuracy of the optimized SSA-BPNN model reaches 98.40%. This study provides an important reference value for the application of an electronic nose in the non-destructive and rapid detection of fungal infection in apples.

      In this paper, a novel feature extraction approach which can be referred to as moving window function capturing (MWFC) has been proposed to analyze signals of an electronic nose (E-nose) used for detecting types of infectious pathogens in rat wounds. Meanwhile, a quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is implemented in conjunction with support vector machine (SVM) for realizing a synchronization optimization of the sensor array and SVM model parameters. The results prove the efficacy of the proposed method for E-nose feature extraction, which can lead to a higher classification accuracy rate compared to other established techniques. Meanwhile it is interesting to note that different classification results can be obtained by changing the types, widths or positions of windows. By selecting the optimum window function for the sensor response, the performance of an E-nose can be enhanced.

      Tympanostomy tube placement has been commonly used nowadays as a surgical treatment for otitis media. Following the placement, regular scheduled follow-ups for checking the status of the tympanostomy tubes are important during the treatment. The complexity of performing the follow up care mainly lies on identifying the presence and patency of the tympanostomy tube. An automated tube detection program will largely reduce the care costs and enhance the clinical efficiency of the ear nose and throat specialists and general practitioners. In this paper, we develop a computer vision system that is able to automatically detect a tympanostomy tube in an otoscopic image of the ear drum. The system comprises an offline classifier training process followed by a real-time refinement stage performed at the point of care. The offline training process constructs a three-layer cascaded classifier with each layer reflecting specific characteristics of the tube. The real-time refinement process enables the end users to interact and adjust the system over time based on their otoscopic images and patient care. The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm has been applied to train all of the classifiers. Empirical evaluation of the proposed system on both high quality hospital images and low quality internet images demonstrates the effectiveness of the system. The offline classifier trained using 215 images could achieve a 90% accuracy in terms of classifying otoscopic images with and without a tympanostomy tube, and then the real-time refinement process could improve the classification accuracy by 3-5% based on additional 20 images.

      A chemical detection platform composed of 8 chemo-resistive gas sensors was exposed to turbulent gas mixtures generated naturally in a wind tunnel. The acquired time series of the sensors are provided. The experimental setup was designed to test gas sensors in realistic environments. Traditionally, chemical detection systems based on chemo-resistive sensors include a gas chamber to control the sample air flow and minimize turbulence. Instead, we utilized a wind tunnel with two independent gas sources that generate two gas plumes. The plumes get naturally mixed along a turbulent flow and reproduce the gas concentration fluctuations observed in natural environments. Hence, the gas sensors can capture the spatio-temporal information contained in the gas plumes. The sensor array was exposed to binary mixtures of ethylene with either methane or carbon monoxide. Volatiles were released at four different rates to induce different concentration levels in the vicinity of the sensor array. Each configuration was repeated 6 times, for a total of 180 measurements. The data is related to ""Chemical Discrimination in Turbulent Gas Mixtures with MOX Sensors Validated by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"", by Fonollosa et al. [1].

      To accurately, safely, and efficiently evaluate the bitterness of Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCMs), a robust predictor was developed using robust partial least squares (RPLS) regression method based on data obtained from an electronic tongue (e-tongue) system. The data quality was verified by the Grubb's test. Moreover, potential outliers were detected based on both the standardized residual and score distance calculated for each sample. The performance of RPLS on the dataset before and after outlier detection was compared to other state-of-the-art methods including multivariate linear regression, least squares support vector machine, and the plain partial least squares regression. Both RÂ² and root-mean-squares error (RMSE) of cross-validation (CV) were recorded for each model. With four latent variables, a robust RMSECV value of 0.3916 with bitterness values ranging from 0.63 to 4.78 were obtained for the RPLS model that was constructed based on the dataset including outliers. Meanwhile, the RMSECV, which was calculated using the models constructed by other methods, was larger than that of the RPLS model. After six outliers were excluded, the performance of all benchmark methods markedly improved, but the difference between the RPLS model constructed before and after outlier exclusion was negligible. In conclusion, the bitterness of TCM decoctions can be accurately evaluated with the RPLS model constructed using e-tongue data.

      The dataset includes the acquired time series of a chemical detection platform exposed to different gas conditions in a turbulent wind tunnel. The chemo-sensory elements were sampling directly the environment. In contrast to traditional approaches that include measurement chambers, open sampling systems are sensitive to dispersion mechanisms of gaseous chemical analytes, namely diffusion, turbulence, and advection, making the identification and monitoring of chemical substances more challenging. The sensing platform included 72 metal-oxide gas sensors that were positioned at 6 different locations of the wind tunnel. At each location, 10 distinct chemical gases were released in the wind tunnel, the sensors were evaluated at 5 different operating temperatures, and 3 different wind speeds were generated in the wind tunnel to induce different levels of turbulence. Moreover, each configuration was repeated 20 times, yielding a dataset of 18,000 measurements. The dataset was collected over a period of 16 months. The data is related to ""On the performance of gas sensor arrays in open sampling systems using Inhibitory Support Vector Machines"", by Vergara et al.[1].

      This paper addresses the localization of a gas emission source within a real-world human environment with a mobile robot. Our approach is based on an efficient and coherent system that fuses different sensor modalities (i.e., vision and chemical sensing) to exploit, for the first time, the semantic relationships among the detected gases and the objects visually recognized in the environment. This novel approach allows the robot to focus the search on a finite set of potential gas source candidates (dynamically updated as the robot operates), while accounting for the non-negligible uncertainties in the object recognition and gas classification tasks involved in the process. This approach is particularly interesting for structured indoor environments containing multiple obstacles and objects, enabling the inference of the relations between objects and between objects and gases. A probabilistic Bayesian framework is proposed to handle all these uncertainties and semantic relations, providing an ordered list of candidates to be the source. This candidate list is updated dynamically upon new sensor measurements to account for objects not previously considered in the search process. The exploitation of such probabilities together with information such as the locations of the objects, or the time needed to validate whether a given candidate is truly releasing gases, is delegated to a path planning algorithm based on Markov decision processes to minimize the search time. The system was tested in an office-like scenario, both with simulated and real experiments, to enable the comparison of different path planning strategies and to validate its efficiency under real-world conditions.
